## Phase I - For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces

* Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form.html , and reservation views.

* Create a basic server using Express.JS

* Create a few array variables that will hold the data

* Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

* Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

* Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server
---------------------


## Phase II - For this second phase, aim to complete the following

* Backend Team:

Create a basic Express server.

Your server at this point should do the BARE MINIMUM. (Effectively, it should just say: "Listening at PORT 3000" when the command node server.js is run.)

* Frontend Team:
---------------------

## Phase III - For this third phase, aim to complete the following

* Backend Team:

Create a set of variables (hint: arrays of objects) for holding the reservation and waitlist data

Create a set of routes that then display this data as JSONs. Users should be given these JSONs if they visit the appropriate page (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/api/tables they should see a JSON of table data).

* Frontend Team:

Temporarily join the backend team. Your task will be to create Express routes that display your HTML pages when a user visits the appropriate page. (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/tables... they should be shown the table.html page.)

If you finish early begin creating the code necessary to convert your form data into JSON objects.
